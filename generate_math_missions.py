PS 1 Greatest Common Factor and Least Common Multiple -
Read through the lesson - This lesson can be done together. Some of the children will need you to help them understand the concepts, play games with them or act as a scribe.
This is a Power Lesson. Power lessons are used to increase your students' level of math mastery. You can do this by submitting a video of your students doing the activity at the end of this lesson or a picture/scan of their written work.
Materials
80 items that are the same (for example cheerios, beans, pennies, blocks, legos)
Two dice
A pencil and scratch paper
Learning Targets
I can find the greatest common factor of two whole numbers less than or equal to 100 and the least common multiple of two whole numbers less than or equal to 12. (6.NS.4 pt 1)
Use the distributive property to express a sum of two whole numbers 1–100 with a common factor as a multiple of a sum of two whole numbers with no common factor. For example, express 36 + 8 as 4(9 + 2). (6.NS.4 pt 2)

Using Least Common Multiple | CK-12 Foundation
Activity
You are going to need several pieces of scratch paper today, a pencil and two dice. Split your first piece of paper into half. Roll your two dice and multiply the two dice and write the product at the top of one side of the paper, for example if you roll a two and a four - write 8. Roll your dice again and write the product on the top of the other side of the paper. You are going to find the greatest common factor of these two numbers. To find the factors you are looking for what numbers can be multiplied together to get that number. You can do this by gathering that number of items and splitting them into even piles and writing down the number in each pile. For example if your number was 12. You could make 1 pile of 12, 2 piles or 6, 3 piles of 4 - so you would write the factors as 1,2,3,4,6,12. Do the same thing with your second number. For example if it is 18, the factors would be 1,2,3,6,9,18. To find the greatest common factor, you circle the biggest number that the two sides have in common. In this case it is 6. Repeat the activity several times.

PS 2 Inequality and absolute value -
Read through the lesson - This lesson can be done together. Some of the children will need you to help them understand the concepts, play games with them or act as a scribe.
This is a Power Lesson. Power lessons are used to increase your students' level of math mastery. You can do this by submitting a video of your students doing the activity at the end of this lesson or a picture/scan of their written work.
This is a lesson that can be done on paper or outside with sidewalk chalk.
Materials
Sidewalk Chalk (on a warm day) or paper and pencil
A dice
Learning Targets
I can understand statements of inequality (Ex: -3 > -7) and explain their positions and distances apart on a number line. (6.NS.7a)
I can write, understand and explain how the order of rational numbers applies in real-world situations (Ex: -3*C > -7*C to show that -3*C is warmer than -7*C). (6.NS.7b)
I understand the absolute value of a number as its distance from 0 on the number line. (6.NS.7c)
I can understand absolute values as they apply to real-world situations (Ex: for an account balance of -30 dollars, write (-30) = 30 to describe the size of the debt in dollars). (6.NS.7c)
I can tell the difference between comparisons of absolute value from statements of order (Ex: An account balance less than -30 dollars is a debt greater than 30 dollars). (6.NS.7d)
Lesson

Negative and Positive Integers Video
Activity
You get to make a really creative number line. If one of your siblings has made a number line already you can just add onto it in the opposite direction, so starting at 0 you would go left and write negative numbers. So your number line will look something like this:
Start at zero. Roll a dice and add that many numbers to the number you are on. (for example if you are standing on 0 and you roll a five, then you will move to number five). The second time you roll your dice you will subtract the number on the dice (so if you roll a six you would move backwards six,if you were on number five then you would move left to -1). Go back and forth between adding and subtracting the number you roll. See how many rolls you can make until you move off the numberline.
Discuss
When everyone is finished, bring the family back together to have a discussion, let the kids have a chance to tell each other what they did on their number line and what they learned. The kids might want a chance to play each other’s games.

I solve unit rate problems. (Ex: If it took 7 hours to mow 4 lawns, then at that rate, how many lawns could be mowed in 35 hours? At what rate were the lawns being mowed?) (6.RP.3b)
I can find a percent of a quantity as a rate per 100. (Ex: 30% of a quantity means 30/100 times the quantity). (6.RP.3c)
I can solve problems involving finding the whole if I am given a part and the percent. (6.RP.3c)

Activity
We are going to make a chart for keeping track of how much you are going to earn doing something. In my example it will be jumping jacks, but feel free to switch it to something you love doing (like shooting a basket) or need to do (pick up toys). You are going to do “jumping jacks” at a rate of $2/per jumping jack. So for every jumping jack you do, you get $2 (in your money kit). Make a chart to figure out how much money you will get if you do a certain amount of jumping jacks. It will look like this:
Jumping Jacks
Money
1
$2
2
$4
How much money will you make if you do 10, 16 and 32 jumping jacks? Do as many jumping jacks as you can up to 50. How many did you do? How much money did you earn? If you did all 50 you would have earned $100. You earned some part of the $100 possible. If you did 34 jumping jacks and got $68 then you got 68/100 of the possible amount or 68%. What percent of the possible did you get?

Make a buck: Object of this game is to be the first person to collect ten cards that exactly equal $1.00. Play with a complete deck of cards; Ace=$0.01, Two=$0.02, Three=$0.03, Four =$0.04...Ten=$0.10, Jack=$0.11, Queen=$0.12, King=$0.13
Shuffle the cards and deal ten cards to each player. Players then take turns drawing and discarding one card at a time until the deck of cards is depleted or a player collects exactly $1.00. This means it will involve a bit of logic and problem solving to discern which cards to keep and which to discard. The first player to collect cards that equal $1.00 wins that round and earns 1 point. If no one has $1.00 after the deck is depleted, the person closest to $1.00 without going over earns .5 of a point. The player with the most points at the end of ten rounds wins!

Finding the average or mean of a set of numbers.

Activity
With all of the students view this document; Dice sums
Discuss the questions on the page about the information shown. What do you learn from this graph?
Roll a dice as many times as you want. Keep track of the numbers that you roll. Once you are done, find the sum of the numbers that you rolled. For instance, if you rolled a 2,5,4,7,2, you would add these numbers together which equals 20. Then divide the sum by the amount of times you rolled, which in this case is 5. 20÷5= 4. Your answer is the average of the numbers that you rolled. It is also called the mean. Notice that when a 2 was rolled a second time, you still write it down. Is there a number that you rolled more often than the other numbers? If you were to play a game with dice, such as monopoly, or sequence, etc., what number would you have the greatest chance of rolling? Could you graph the outcome of your rolls? What if you rolled more than 5 times, how would that change your average?
After looking at the first graph, which pairs would be the most likely to be rolled when playing a game with 2 dice?

Activity
Today we will all be measuring things around our house and keeping track of what we measure. We will write down what we find out and can tell each other what we learned when we are done.
Measure the length, width and height of the book using inches. Record your answers and then figure out the volume of a book by using the formula V=lwh (Volume=length*width*height). This will give you an answer in inches cubed, or in^3. Next convert your measurements to centimeters from inches using the ratio 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters. Figure out the volume again this time in cm^3. Here is an example to help you out:
Discuss
When they are all finished, bring the family back together to have a discussion. Ask the following questions:
Which did you measure?
was the most challenging task? Why?
