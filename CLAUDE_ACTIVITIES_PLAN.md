# Claude Code Interactive Activities Plan
## Hunter Training System for Hyro

### Vision
Transform each mission into an interactive learning experience where Hyro works WITH Claude Code as his AI training companion. Claude acts as a "Shadow Monarch's Guide" - teaching concepts through conversation, quizzes, and challenges that REQUIRE understanding before the student can proceed to the final assignment.

---

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Mastery Gates (Can't Skip Without Understanding)
- Each activity has **checkpoints** where Claude asks questions
- Wrong answers = Claude explains and asks again (different angle)
- Must demonstrate understanding 3 times before "unlocking" the assignment
- Claude tracks progress and won't say "you're ready" until mastery is shown

### 2. Progressive Claude Interaction Skills
Hyro learns to use Claude effectively:
- **E-Rank**: Simple prompts ("Explain this to me")
- **D-Rank**: Asking for examples ("Show me an example of...")
- **C-Rank**: Requesting verification ("Check if my answer is correct...")
- **B-Rank**: Collaborative problem-solving ("Help me work through this...")
- **A-Rank**: Teaching back ("Let me explain this to you and you tell me if I'm right")

### 3. The "Teach-Back" Requirement
For every mission, before getting the "Quest Cleared" status, Hyro must EXPLAIN the concept back to Claude in his own words. Claude evaluates if the explanation demonstrates true understanding.

### 4. Fun Integration
- XP rewards for good explanations
- "Skill Unlocked" messages when concepts are mastered
- Boss battles = harder quiz questions
- Claude plays the role of training companion, not teacher
