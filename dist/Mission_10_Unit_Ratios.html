Power lessons are used to increase your students' level of math mastery. You can do this by submitting a video of your students doing the activity at the end of this lesson or a picture/scan of their written work.</p><hr></div><div class='mission-card'><h2>🎒 1. Gear Checklist</h2><p><strong>Gather these exact items:</strong></p><p>Paper and pencil for each group</p></div><div class='mission-card'><h2>🎯 2. Your Objectives</h2><p>Unit ratios</p><p>I understand how to find a rate when given a specific ratio. (Ex: We paid $75 for 15 hamburgers, which is a rate of $5 per hamburger). (6.RP.2)</p></div><div class='mission-card'><h2>🧠 3. Brain Download (The Lesson)</h2><p>Links for videos and activities to learn:</p><p>Rates and Ratios Video</p><p>Price Unit Rates | CK-12 Foundation</p></div><div class='mission-card'><h2>🗺️ 4. The Adventure (Activity)</h2><h3>📜 Verbatim Instructions:</h3><p>Activity</p><p>Choose your favorite sport(s) or a variety to complete activities</p><p>Math can be found in many different sports.  You may want to focus on one or more sports that your children are interested in and help them solve problems using that sport.  Listed below are the areas that each grade should be working on and example problems for them to solve.</p><p>A basketball teams season goes as follows;</p><p>1st game Loss; 2nd game Loss; 3rd game Win; 4th game Win; 5th game Win; 6th game Win; 7th game Win; 8th game Loss; 9th game Win; 10th game Loss; 11th game Loss; 12 game Win; 13th game Loss; 14th game Loss; 15th game Loss; 16th game Win. What is the ratio of wins to losses?</p><p>There are 2 swim teams at a swim meet.  One team has 16 boys and 13 girls.  The second team has 14 boys and 7 girls.  What is the ratio of boys to girls at the swim meet?</p><p>A wrestler has a ratio of 3 wins for every 2 losses.  If the wrestler has won 12 matches.  How many matches has he lost? Then find out how many total matches he has wrestled?</p><p>See how many baskets you can make in 10 attempts.  What is your ratio of baskets made/attempts? How many baskets do you think you would make if you made 20 attempts?  Try it.  Did you get the same ratio?</p><p>For some of the online activities you will need a free CK12 account.</p><p>To create a CK12 account:</p><p>Go to: https://www.ck12.org/student/</p><p>Click on the orange JOIN button in the upper right corner</p><p>Choose the option for email to sign up.</p><p>Enter your student's information. CK12 will ask students to input their teacher email. PLEASE ENTER THE TEACHER'S EMAIL: and the teacher will complete the registration process.</p><p>When registration is complete, the teacher will email you the username and password for your student account.</p><h3>💡 🚀 Mission Strategy: Step-by-Step</h3><p>*(Use this guide to help you complete the instructions above)*</p><p>1. Pick a sport (Basketball, Swim, Wrestling) from the list.</p><p>2. <strong>Basketball:</strong> Count the Wins (W) and Losses (L) in the list. Write Ratio W:L.</p><p>3. <strong>Swim:</strong> Compare Boys to Girls. (e.g., 16 boys, 13 girls = 16:13).</p><p>4. <strong>Wrestling:</strong> Use the ratio (3 wins for every 2 losses) to predict the future.</p><p>5. <strong>Your Turn:</strong> Shoot 10 baskets. Count how many you make. Write the ratio.</p><pre>$$$$$$
