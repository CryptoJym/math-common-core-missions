<div class='mission-card'><h1>🚀 Mission 03: Ratios with Money</h1><p>*Time to earn some money! You get paid $2.00 for every jumping jack.*</p><h3>📜 The Instructions</h3><p>Ratios with Money -</p><p>Read through the lesson - This lesson can be done together. Some of the children will need you to help them understand the concepts, play games with them or act as a scribe.</p><p>This is a Power Lesson.  Power lessons are used to increase your students' level of math mastery. You can do this by submitting a video of your students doing the activity at the end of this lesson or a picture/scan of their written work.</p><hr></div><div class='mission-card'><h2>🎒 1. Gear Checklist</h2><p><strong>Gather these exact items:</strong></p><p>Set of play money.</p><p>Five dice</p></div><div class='mission-card'><h2>🎯 2. Your Objectives</h2><p>Learn that money can be used to understand math concepts.</p><p>I solve unit rate problems. (Ex: If it took 7 hours to mow 4 lawns, then at that rate, how many lawns could be mowed in 35 hours? At what rate were the lawns being mowed?) (6.RP.3b)</p><p>I can find a percent of a quantity as a rate per 100. (Ex: 30% of a quantity means 30/100 times the quantity). (6.RP.3c)</p><p>I can solve problems involving finding the whole if I am given a part and the percent. (6.RP.3c)</p></div><div class='mission-card'><h2>🧠 3.

The Adventure (Activity)</h2><h3>📜 Verbatim Instructions:</h3><p>We are going to make a chart for keeping track of how much you are going to earn doing something. In my example it will be jumping jacks, but feel free to switch it to something you love doing (like shooting a basket) or need to do (pick up toys). You are going to do “jumping jacks” at a rate of $2/per jumping jack. So for every jumping jack you do, you get $2  (in your money kit). Make a chart to figure out how much money you will get if you do a certain amount of jumping jacks. It will look like this:</p><p>Jumping Jacks</p><p>Money</p><p>1</p><p>$2</p><p>2</p><p>$4</p><p>How much money will you make if you do 10, 16 and 32 jumping jacks?  Do as many jumping jacks as you can up to 50. How many did you do? How much money did you earn?  If you did all 50 you would have earned $100. You earned some part of the $100 possible. If you did 34 jumping jacks and got $68 then you got 68/100 of the possible amount or 68%. What percent of the possible did you get?</p><p>Optional Resources</p><p>For more practice:</p><p>Khan Academy Percent Practice</p><p>Khan Academy: Rates and Ratios Practice</p><p>For instruction on greater than, less than and equal to you can try these videos:</p><p>Math Antics Rate Video</p><p>Math Antics Percent Video</p><p>For some of the online activities you will need a free CK12 account.</p><p>To create a CK12 account:</p><p>Go to: https://www.ck12.org/student/</p><p>Click on the orange JOIN button in the upper right corner</p><p>Choose the option for email to sign up.</p><p>Enter your student's information. CK12 will ask students to input their teacher email. PLEASE ENTER THE TEACHER'S EMAIL: and the teacher will complete the registration process.</p><p>When registration is complete, the teacher will email you the username and password for your student account.</p><h3>💡 🚀 Mission Strategy: Step-by-Step</h3><p>*(Use this guide to help you complete the instructions above)*</p><p>1. Draw a chart with two columns: 'Jumping Jacks' and 'Money'.</p><p>2. Row 1: 1 Jack = $2.</p><p>3. Row 2: 2 Jacks = $4.</p><p>4. Fill in the rest for 10, 16, and 32 jacks.</p><p>5. <strong>The Big Challenge:</strong> Do as many as you can (max 50).</p><p>6. Calculate your pay: (Number of Jacks) x $2.</p><p>7. Calculate your percent: (Number of Jacks / 50) x 100.</p><pre>.-------.    .-------.
