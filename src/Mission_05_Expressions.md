# 🚀 Mission 05: Expressions

*Welcome to the Algebra Café! You are the owner.*

### 📜 The Instructions
Expressions -
Read through the lesson - This lesson can be done together. Some of the children will need you to help them understand the concepts, play games with them or act as a scribe.

This is a Power Lesson.  Power lessons are used to increase your students' level of math mastery. You can do this by submitting a video of your students doing the activity at the end of this lesson or a picture/scan of their written work. 

This activity can be done at any time, but lunchtime is convenient because you would be eating anyway. In preparation your family needs to make food to use in your restaurant.

## 🗺️ 4. The Adventure (Activity)
### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
Your kids can help you make a restaurant for lunch. The menu has different slots for the prices, because different age groups will need to work with different size numbers, i.e. a kindergarten could have a sandwich cost 5 cents where a fifth grader could have it cost $5.95. If you have children in fourth-sixth grade make sure that some prices include decimals. Specific instructions per grade are included below.

After you make the menu figure out how much it would cost if you bought A+B+C (The letters are on the side of the menu).  What if you bought 2A+4B+D?

### 💡 🚀 Mission Strategy: Step-by-Step
*(Use this guide to help you complete the instructions above)*
1. Create a Menu with 4 items. Give each a letter code (A, B, C, D) and a price.
2. **Order 1:** Calculate cost of A + B + C.
3. **Order 2:** Calculate 2A + 4B + D (That means 2 of item A, 4 of item B...)
4. Serve the food to your family and give them the bill!
