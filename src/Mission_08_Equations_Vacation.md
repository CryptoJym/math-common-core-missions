## 🗺️ 4. The Adventure (Activity)
### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
Together:  Pretend we are planning a trip to an amusement park in Orlando, Florida. Which amusement park would you like to go to? Research what parks you can visit.  What do you need to plan if you want to go on a trip? Discuss: How will we get there? How do we get around once we are there? Where will we stay? What will we eat?  What time of year should we go?  Is it cold or hot?  Does it get colder at night?  How late is the park open? 

Help solve problems on the Family Vacation worksheet.  Then take the final total and divide by either 6 or 12 months to see how much the family would need to save each month to go on this vacation.  They may be able to decide to change some of the activities too.  
Extension:  If your family wants to plan a family vacation somewhere else, work together to decide how much it would cost to go to the other location.
