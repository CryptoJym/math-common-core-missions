## 🗺️ 4. The Adventure (Activity)
### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
Make tables of equivalent ratios relating quantities with whole-number measurements, find missing values in the tables, and plot the pairs of values on the coordinate plane. Use tables to compare ratios.

Using the information gathered for the pom pom graphs, make a table to compare the ratios of various pom pom colors. Next, make a table with equivalent ratios.  Imagine that there were triple or quadruple the number of pom poms and find the equivalent ratios.
