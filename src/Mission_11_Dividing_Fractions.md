### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
Get the fraction manipulatives ready for the students
Review the rules for dividing fractions.
Ask the students if they had ⅔ of a pizza and they divide the ⅔ by ½ how many pieces would they have? Give other similar problems such as ¾ ÷ ¼ ; ⅖ ÷ ½ Your family got 4 kinds of pizza for dinner last night.  1/3 of the pineapple, 1/4 of the pepperoni and 1/2 of the cheese is left.  You want to split each kind in 1/2 with your brother.  How much pizza will you get?
