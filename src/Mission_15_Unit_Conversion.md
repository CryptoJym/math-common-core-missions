## 🗺️ 4. The Adventure (Activity)
### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
Today we will all be measuring things around our house and keeping track of what we measure. We will write down what we find out and can tell each other what we learned when we are done.
Measure the length, width and height of the book using inches. Record your answers and then figure out the volume of a book  by using the formula V=lwh (Volume=length*width*height). This will give you an answer in inches cubed, or in^3.  Next convert your measurements to centimeters from inches using the ratio 1 inch = 2.54 centimeters. Figure out the volume again this time in cm^3. Here is an example to help you out:




Discuss 



When they are all finished, bring the family back together to have a discussion.  Ask the following questions:

Which did you measure?
was the most challenging task? Why?
