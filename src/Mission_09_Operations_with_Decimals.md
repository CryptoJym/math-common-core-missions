## 🗺️ 4. The Adventure (Activity)
### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
Fluently add, subtract, multiply, and divide multi-digit decimals using the standard algorithm for each operation.
Make a buck: Object of this game is to be the first person to collect ten cards that exactly equal $1.00.  Play with a complete deck of cards; Ace=$0.01, Two=$0.02, Three=$0.03, Four =$0.04...Ten=$0.10, Jack=$0.11, Queen=$0.12, King=$0.13
Shuffle the cards and deal ten cards to each player. Players then take turns drawing and discarding one card at a time until the deck of cards is depleted or a player collects exactly $1.00.  This means it will involve a bit of logic and problem solving to discern which cards to keep and which to discard. The first player to collect cards that equal $1.00 wins that round and earns 1 point. If no one has $1.00 after the deck is depleted, the person closest to $1.00 without going over earns .5 of a point. The player with the most points at the end of ten rounds wins!
