# 🚀 Mission 06: Identifying Parts of Expressions

*We are looking at the 'anatomy' of math sentences.*

### 📜 The Instructions
Identifying Parts of Expressions -
Read through the lesson - This lesson can be done together. Some of the children will need you to help them understand the concepts, play games with them or act as a scribe.

This is a Power Lesson.  Power lessons are used to increase your students' level of math mastery. You can do this by submitting a video of your students doing the activity at the end of this lesson or a picture/scan of their written work.

## 🎒 1. Gear Checklist
**Gather these exact items:**
Toys, play money and papers to write prices on.

## 🎯 2. Your Objectives
I can name the parts of an expression using mathematical words (sum, term, product, factor, quotient, coefficient). (6.EE.2b)
I can look at one or more parts of an expression in different ways. (Ex: 8 + 7 can be seen as an addition sentence or as the number 15). (6.EE.2b)

## 🗺️ 4. The Adventure (Activity)
### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
Today we are going to make a pretend store. Have them make a store with their favorite toys. The different age groups will need to have appropriate prices for their age group. Set up the store in advance.
Go to your store and figure out the following:
The sum (the answer when you add them) if you buy two of the objects.
The difference (the answer when you subtract)  between how much money you have and how much you will need if you buy those two items.
The product (the answer when you multiply) if you buy multiples of one item.
Find the quotient (the answer when you divide) to figure out how much each item cost if you spent 72 cents and you bought nine of them?
Write an equation to represent what you did that includes coefficients, factors  and terms.

### 💡 🚀 Mission Strategy: Step-by-Step
*(Use this guide to help you complete the instructions above)*
1. Set up a store with toys and price tags.
2. Pick two toys.
3. **Sum:** Add the prices.
4. **Difference:** Subtract the smaller price from the bigger one.
5. **Product:** What if you bought 5 of the same toy? Multiply price x 5.
6. **Quotient:** If you have 72 cents, how many of this toy can you buy? (72 / price).
7. Write a math sentence (equation) for what you just did.

```

 .$$$  $$$.
 $  $$$$  $
 $  $$$$  $
 '$$$  $$$'
   $$$$$$
```

**Parent Instructions:**
To pass this mission off, please check the following:
- [ ] Ask them to point to the 'Coefficient' or 'Term' in their equation. (e.g., in 5x + 2, 5 is the coefficient).
- [ ] Did they complete the verbatim instructions listed in Section 4?
- [ ] Did they watch the lesson video?
