## 🎒 1. Gear Checklist
**Gather these exact items:**
Set of play money.
Five dice

## 🎯 2. Your Objectives
Learn that money can be used to understand math concepts.
I solve unit rate problems. (Ex: If it took 7 hours to mow 4 lawns, then at that rate, how many lawns could be mowed in 35 hours? At what rate were the lawns being mowed?) (6.RP.3b)
I can find a percent of a quantity as a rate per 100. (Ex: 30% of a quantity means 30/100 times the quantity). (6.RP.3c)
I can solve problems involving finding the whole if I am given a part and the percent. (6.RP.3c)

## 🗺️ 4. The Adventure (Activity)
### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
We are going to make a chart for keeping track of how much you are going to earn doing something. In my example it will be jumping jacks, but feel free to switch it to something you love doing (like shooting a basket) or need to do (pick up toys). You are going to do “jumping jacks” at a rate of $2/per jumping jack. So for every jumping jack you do, you get $2  (in your money kit). Make a chart to figure out how much money you will get if you do a certain amount of jumping jacks. It will look like this:



Jumping Jacks

Money

1

$2

2

$4



















How much money will you make if you do 10, 16 and 32 jumping jacks?  Do as many jumping jacks as you can up to 50. How many did you do? How much money did you earn?  If you did all 50 you would have earned $100. You earned some part of the $100 possible. If you did 34 jumping jacks and got $68 then you got 68/100 of the possible amount or 68%. What percent of the possible did you get?

### 💡 🚀 Mission Strategy: Step-by-Step
*(Use this guide to help you complete the instructions above)*
1. Draw a chart with two columns: 'Jumping Jacks' and 'Money'.
2. Row 1: 1 Jack = $2.
3. Row 2: 2 Jacks = $4.
4. Fill in the rest for 10, 16, and 32 jacks.
5. **The Big Challenge:** Do as many as you can (max 50).
6. Calculate your pay: (Number of Jacks) x $2.
7. Calculate your percent: (Number of Jacks / 50) x 100.
