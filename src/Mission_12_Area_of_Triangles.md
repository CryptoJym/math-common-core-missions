## 🎒 1. Gear Checklist
**Gather these exact items:**
Post-it notes or paper & tape
Play dough or clay
Graph paper
Rulers or tape measures for older students

## 🎯 2. Your Objectives
I can find the area of right triangles, other triangles, special quadrilaterals, and polygons by composing and decomposing into rectangles, triangles and/or other shapes. (6.G.1)
I can use these techniques to solve real-world and mathematical problems. (6.G.1)

## 🗺️ 4. The Adventure (Activity)
### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
Activity



Find the area of right triangles, other triangles, special quadrilaterals, and polygons by composing and decomposing into rectangles, triangles and/or other shapes. 
Using graph paper draw triangles and practice finding the area of a triangle. A= ½ base X height; Here is a link to explore how to find the base and height of a triangle; Illustrative math.
Find the area of a rectangle, (this can be done by finding rectangles around the house or drawing them on graph paper) then divide it in half to find the area of a triangle that would fit in the rectangle.  If drawing this on a graph paper, draw the triangle inside of the rectangle.
Here are links to activities on finding the area of polygons.  You may choose to use one or both of these;

Extension:Quilt Triangles.  This might be a fun extension activity to explore the area of triangles.

### 💡 🚀 Mission Strategy: Step-by-Step
*(Use this guide to help you complete the instructions above)*
1. Draw a rectangle on graph paper. Count the squares to find Area (Base x Height).
2. Cut the rectangle in half diagonally.
3. Look! You have two triangles. That's why Triangle Area = 1/2 Base x Height.
4. **Extension:** Create a 'Quilt' pattern using different colored paper triangles.
