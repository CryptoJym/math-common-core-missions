# 🚀 Mission 01: Greatest Common Factor

*Get ready to battle numbers with dice! In this mission, you'll learn how to break numbers down into their building blocks (Factors).*

### 📜 The Instructions
Greatest Common Factor and Least Common Multiple -
Read through the lesson - This lesson can be done together. Some of the children will need you to help them understand the concepts, play games with them or act as a scribe.

This is a Power Lesson.  Power lessons are used to increase your students' level of math mastery. You can do this by submitting a video of your students doing the activity at the end of this lesson or a picture/scan of their written work.

## 🎒 1. Gear Checklist
**Gather these exact items:**
80 items that are the same (for example cheerios, beans, pennies, blocks, legos) 
Two dice
A pencil and scratch paper

## 🎯 2. Your Objectives
I can find the greatest common factor of two whole numbers less than or equal to 100 and the least common multiple of two whole numbers less than or equal to 12. (6.NS.4 pt 1)

Use the distributive property to express a sum of two whole numbers 1–100 with a common factor as a multiple of a sum of two whole numbers with no common factor. For example, express 36 + 8 as 4(9 + 2). (6.NS.4 pt 2)

## 🗺️ 4. The Adventure (Activity)
### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
You are going to need several pieces of scratch paper today, a pencil and two dice. Split your first piece of paper into half. Roll your two dice and multiply the two dice and write the product at the top of one side of the paper, for example if you roll a two and a four - write 8. Roll your dice again and write the product on the top of the other side of the paper. You are going to find the greatest common factor of these two numbers. To find the factors you are looking for what numbers can be multiplied together to get that number. You can do this by gathering that number of items and splitting them into even piles and writing down the number in each pile. For example if your number was 12. You could make 1 pile of 12, 2 piles or 6, 3 piles of 4 - so you would write the factors as 1,2,3,4,6,12. Do the same thing with your second number. For example if it is 18, the factors would be 1,2,3,6,9,18.  To find the greatest common factor, you circle the biggest number that the two sides have in common. In this case it is 6. Repeat the activity several times.

### 💡 🚀 Mission Strategy: Step-by-Step
*(Use this guide to help you complete the instructions above)*
1. Take a piece of paper and draw a line down the middle.
2. **Left Side:** Roll your two dice. Multiply the numbers together (e.g., 2 x 4 = 8). Write that number at the top.
3. **Right Side:** Roll again. Multiply them. Write that number at the top.
4. **Find Factors:** Use your 80 items. If your number is 12, count 12 items. Can you split them into 2 equal piles? 3? 4? 5? If yes, write down the number of piles.
5. List all the factors for both numbers.
6. Circle the numbers that appear on **BOTH** lists. The biggest one is the Winner (GCF)!

```
  .-------.    .-------.
 /   o   /|   /   o   /|
/_______/o|  /_______/o|
| o     | |  | o     | |
|   o   |o/  |   o   |o/
|     o |/   |     o |/
'-------'    '-------'
```
