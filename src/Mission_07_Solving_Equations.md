Make a pile of 12 blocks. Roll the dice to determine the value of A in the following equation. Calculate what X will be when X + A = 12 
Make a group of “B” blocks (see chart below). Split the blocks into A (see chart below) groups. How many are in each group? X represents the number in each group.

### 💡 🚀 Mission Strategy: Step-by-Step
*(Use this guide to help you complete the instructions above)*
1. **Part 1 (Addition):** Equation is X + A = 12.
2. Roll dice to find 'A' (e.g., 4).
3. Solve: X + 4 = 12. (Answer: X must be 8). Check with blocks!
4. **Part 2 (Multiplication):** Equation is AX = B.
5. Use the chart provided in the instructions. If A=3 and B=12...
6. Split 12 blocks into 3 piles. How many in each pile? That is X.

```

**Parent Instructions:**
To pass this mission off, please check the following:
- [ ] Verify they are isolating the variable. In Part 2, do they understand they are dividing B by A to get X?
- [ ] Did they complete the verbatim instructions listed in Section 4?
- [ ] Did they watch the lesson video?
