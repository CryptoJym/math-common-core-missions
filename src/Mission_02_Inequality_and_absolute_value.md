# 🚀 Mission 02: Inequality and absolute value

*You are going to build a giant map of numbers on the floor!*

### 📜 The Instructions
Inequality and absolute value -
Read through the lesson - This lesson can be done together. Some of the children will need you to help them understand the concepts, play games with them or act as a scribe.

This is a Power Lesson.  Power lessons are used to increase your students' level of math mastery. You can do this by submitting a video of your students doing the activity at the end of this lesson or a picture/scan of their written work. 

This is a lesson that can be done on paper or outside with sidewalk chalk.

## 🎒 1. Gear Checklist
**Gather these exact items:**
Sidewalk Chalk (on a warm day) or paper and pencil
A dice

## 🎯 2. Your Objectives
I can understand statements of inequality (Ex: -3 > -7) and explain their positions and distances apart on a number line. (6.NS.7a)
I can write, understand and explain how the order of rational numbers applies in real-world situations (Ex: -3*C > -7*C to show that -3*C is warmer than -7*C). (6.NS.7b)
I understand the absolute value of a number as its distance from 0 on the number line. (6.NS.7c)
I can understand absolute values as they apply to real-world situations (Ex: for an account balance of -30 dollars, write (-30) = 30 to describe the size of the debt in dollars). (6.NS.7c)
I can tell the difference between comparisons of absolute value from statements of order (Ex: An account balance less than -30 dollars is a debt greater than 30 dollars). (6.NS.7d)

## 🗺️ 4. The Adventure (Activity)
### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
You get to make a really creative number line. If one of your siblings has made a number line already you can just add onto it in the opposite direction, so starting at 0 you would go left and write negative numbers. So your number line will look something like this: 





Start at zero. Roll a dice and add that many numbers to the number you are on. (for example if you are standing on 0 and you roll a five, then you will move to number five). The second time you roll your dice you will subtract the number on the dice (so if you roll a six you would move backwards six,if you were on number five then you would move left to -1). Go back and forth between adding and subtracting the number you roll. See how many rolls you can make until you move off the numberline.


Discuss



When everyone is  finished, bring the family back together to have a discussion, let the kids have a chance to tell each other what they did on their number line and what they learned. The kids might want a chance to play each other’s games.

### 💡 🚀 Mission Strategy: Step-by-Step
*(Use this guide to help you complete the instructions above)*
1. Draw a number line. Put **0** in the middle. Positive numbers go Right (1, 2, 3). Negative numbers go Left (-1, -2, -3).
2. Stand on Zero.
3. **Roll 1:** Move that many steps Forward (Right).
4. **Roll 2:** Move that many steps Backward (Left). (e.g., if you are at 5 and roll 6, you go past zero to -1).
5. Keep adding and subtracting steps until you fall off your line!

```
  .-------.    .-------.
 /   o   /|   /   o   /|
/_______/o|  /_______/o|
| o     | |  | o     | |
|   o   |o/  |   o   |o/
|     o |/   |     o |/
'-------'    '-------'
```

**Parent Instructions:**
To pass this mission off, please check the following:
- [ ] Watch them move. When they cross zero (going from positive to negative), do they count correctly? (e.g., 2 minus 3 equals -1).
- [ ] Did they complete the verbatim instructions listed in Section 4?
- [ ] Did they watch the lesson video?
