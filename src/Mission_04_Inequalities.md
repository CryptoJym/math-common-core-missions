*A Scavenger Hunt for math! X marks the spot.*

### 📜 The Instructions
Inequalities -
Read through the lesson - This lesson can be done together. Some of the children will need you to help them understand the concepts, play games with them or act as a scribe.

This is a Power Lesson.  Power lessons are used to increase your students' level of math mastery. You can do this by submitting a video of your students doing the activity at the end of this lesson or a picture/scan of their written work.

## 🎒 1. Gear Checklist
**Gather these exact items:**
Any set of cards with numbers that you have - just keep the numbers 1-9  (i.e. Uno, Rook, or face cards) or You can make them by cutting out 40 same sized papers (or use index cards) and labeling them 0-9 (4 sets).
Two dice 
Greater than, less than, or equal cards. (use 3 index card or piece of paper to create with symbols <, >, =)

## 🎯 2. Your Objectives
I can write an inequality (x > c or x < c) to stand for a limitation or condition in a real-world or mathematical problem that has infinitely many solutions. (6.EE.8)
I can show the answers to problems involving inequalities on number line diagrams. (6.EE.8)

## 🗺️ 4. The Adventure (Activity)
### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
Using the three cards that represent > (greater than) < (less than) and = (equal to). Explain to your students what each card represents.



We use letters to represent numbers that we don’t know. Today you are going to roll your dice and write the number in all three places on the graph below. You will then take your ruler and find several things around the house that are greater than, less than or equal to the number your roll. For example if you roll a six. Then the first column would be things which are greater than six inches, the second column would be equal to six inches and the last column is for things less than six inches.

X > ____

X = _______

X < _________

### 💡 🚀 Mission Strategy: Step-by-Step
*(Use this guide to help you complete the instructions above)*
1. Draw a chart with 3 rows: **X > (Greater)**, **X = (Equal)**, **X < (Less)**.
2. Roll your dice (e.g., you roll a 6). Write '6' in the blanks.
3. **Greater Than:** Find an object longer than 6 inches.
4. **Equal:** Find an object exactly 6 inches.
5. **Less Than:** Find an object shorter than 6 inches.
6. Repeat for 3 different rolls!

```
  .-------.    .-------.
 /   o   /|   /   o   /|
/_______/o|  /_______/o|
| o     | |  | o     | |
|   o   |o/  |   o   |o/
|     o |/   |     o |/
