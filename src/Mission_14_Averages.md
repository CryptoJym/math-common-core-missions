## 🎯 2. Your Objectives
Reading, interpreting & creating graphs & data. 
Finding the average or mean of a set of numbers.
I can find the average of a number and recognize that the average or measure of center for a numerical data set summarizes all of its values with a single number, while a measure of variation describes how its values vary with a single number.  (6.SP.3)

### 📜 Verbatim Instructions:
With all of the students view this document; Dice sums
Discuss the questions on the page about the information shown. What do you learn from this graph?
Roll a dice as many times as you want.  Keep track of the numbers that you roll.  Once you are done, find the sum of the numbers that you rolled.  For instance, if you rolled a 2,5,4,7,2, you would add these numbers together which equals 20.  Then divide the sum by the amount of times you rolled, which in this case is 5.  20÷5= 4.  Your answer is the average of the numbers that you rolled.  It is also called the mean.  Notice that when a 2 was rolled a second time, you still write it down.  Is there a number that you rolled more often than the other numbers? If you were to play a game with dice, such as monopoly, or sequence, etc., what number would you have the greatest chance of rolling?  Could you graph the outcome of your rolls?  What if you rolled more than 5 times, how would that change your average? 
After looking at the first graph, which pairs would be the most likely to be rolled when playing a game with 2 dice?

### 💡 🚀 Mission Strategy: Step-by-Step
*(Use this guide to help you complete the instructions above)*
1. Roll a die 5 times. Write the numbers (e.g., 2, 5, 4, 7, 2).
2. **Sum:** Add them up (2+5+4+7+2 = 20).
3. **Count:** You rolled 5 times.
4. **Average:** Divide Sum by Count (20 / 5 = 4).
5. Repeat with more rolls!
