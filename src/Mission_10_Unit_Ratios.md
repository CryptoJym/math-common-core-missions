Activity



Choose your favorite sport(s) or a variety to complete activities
Math can be found in many different sports.  You may want to focus on one or more sports that your children are interested in and help them solve problems using that sport.  Listed below are the areas that each grade should be working on and example problems for them to solve. 
A basketball teams season goes as follows;
1st game Loss; 2nd game Loss; 3rd game Win; 4th game Win; 5th game Win; 6th game Win; 7th game Win; 8th game Loss; 9th game Win; 10th game Loss; 11th game Loss; 12 game Win; 13th game Loss; 14th game Loss; 15th game Loss; 16th game Win. What is the ratio of wins to losses?
There are 2 swim teams at a swim meet.  One team has 16 boys and 13 girls.  The second team has 14 boys and 7 girls.  What is the ratio of boys to girls at the swim meet?
A wrestler has a ratio of 3 wins for every 2 losses.  If the wrestler has won 12 matches.  How many matches has he lost? Then find out how many total matches he has wrestled?
See how many baskets you can make in 10 attempts.  What is your ratio of baskets made/attempts? How many baskets do you think you would make if you made 20 attempts?  Try it.  Did you get the same ratio?

### 💡 🚀 Mission Strategy: Step-by-Step
*(Use this guide to help you complete the instructions above)*
1. Pick a sport (Basketball, Swim, Wrestling) from the list.
2. **Basketball:** Count the Wins (W) and Losses (L) in the list. Write Ratio W:L.
3. **Swim:** Compare Boys to Girls. (e.g., 16 boys, 13 girls = 16:13).
4. **Wrestling:** Use the ratio (3 wins for every 2 losses) to predict the future.
5. **Your Turn:** Shoot 10 baskets. Count how many you make. Write the ratio.

## 🤝 5. Parent Captain's Log
> **STOP!** 🛑 Grab a parent or guardian.

**Parent Instructions:**
To pass this mission off, please check the following:
- [ ] Check the Wrestling problem. If ratio is 3:2 (Wins:Losses) and he won 12... that means 3x4=12, so losses must be 2x4=8. Total matches = 12+8=20.
- [ ] Did they complete the verbatim instructions listed in Section 4?
- [ ] Did they watch the lesson video?
